# Explainability UX Copy Guidelines

> **Purpose**: Ensure all user-facing text in Aivo's explainability features is strength-based, non-pathologizing, and honest about AI limitations.

## Core Principles

### 1. Growth-Oriented Language

Use language that emphasizes progress, effort, and potential rather than deficits or comparisons.

| ✅ Use | ❌ Avoid |
|--------|----------|
| "building skills" | "behind" |
| "practicing" | "struggling" |
| "growing confidence" | "failing" |
| "working on" | "can't do" |
| "developing" | "weak at" |
| "making progress" | "not capable" |
| "taking time to master" | "slow" |

### 2. Non-Pathologizing Language

Never apply diagnostic labels or suggest medical conditions. Aivo is an educational tool, not a diagnostic system.

| ✅ Use | ❌ Avoid |
|--------|----------|
| "learns best when..." | "has ADHD" |
| "benefits from shorter sessions" | "is hyperactive" |
| "responds well to visual content" | "is dyslexic" |
| "prefers hands-on activities" | "has a learning disability" |
| "needs more time with this concept" | "is developmentally delayed" |

### 3. Partnership Framing

Position Aivo as a supportive tool working alongside families and educators—never as the authority.

**Preferred phrases:**
- "Aivo is here to help you and your child..."
- "Together with your guidance..."
- "To support your teaching..."
- "Working alongside you..."

**Avoid:**
- "Aivo knows best..."
- "You should..."
- "Your child needs to..."

### 4. Honest Uncertainty

Be transparent about what AI can and cannot do. Never overstate confidence.

**Always include appropriate disclaimers:**
- "Aivo's suggestions are based on patterns in your child's recent work. They may not always be perfect."
- "Use your professional judgment. Aivo's suggestions are one input among many."
- "This is a suggestion, not a diagnosis or prescription."

## Standard Phrases

### Explanation Openers

Use these to introduce why Aivo made a decision:

- "We chose this because..."
- "This suggestion is based on..."
- "Aivo noticed that..."
- "Based on recent activity..."
- "To help build on..."

### Limitation Acknowledgments

Include these where appropriate:

- "Aivo's suggestions are based on patterns and may not always be perfect."
- "This is one way to look at things—you know your learner best."
- "AI suggestions work best when combined with your own observations."

### Encouragement Patterns

- "Keep up the great work!"
- "Every bit of practice helps build skills."
- "Learning takes time, and that's okay."
- "Progress isn't always a straight line."

## Context-Specific Guidelines

### Parent App

**Tone**: Warm, supportive, collaborative
**Reading level**: Accessible to all parents (aim for 8th grade reading level)

**Key messages:**
1. You are the expert on your child
2. Aivo is here to help, not replace you
3. Learning is a journey, not a race
4. Every child's path is unique

**Example:**
> "Aivo chose this activity because your child has been building confidence with addition. This is a great next step to keep that momentum going!"

### Teacher App

**Tone**: Professional, respectful of expertise, data-informed
**Reading level**: Professional but not jargon-heavy

**Key messages:**
1. Your professional judgment matters most
2. Aivo provides data to inform, not dictate
3. You know your students best
4. These are suggestions, not mandates

**Example:**
> "This recommendation is based on recent assessment data. Use your professional judgment to determine if it's right for this learner."

### Admin/Platform Apps

**Tone**: Transparent, technical where appropriate, honest about limitations
**Reading level**: Professional, can include more technical detail

**Key messages:**
1. AI systems have limitations
2. We take bias and safety seriously
3. Human oversight is essential
4. Transparency is a priority

**Example:**
> "This model was trained on educational content and may reflect biases present in that data. Regular audits and safety policies help mitigate risks."

## Empty States & Error Messages

### When No Explanation is Available

**Don't say:**
> "Error: No explanation found"

**Do say:**
> "We don't have a detailed explanation for this yet. Aivo used recent activity and learning goals to make this choice."

### When There's a Backend Error

**Don't say:**
> "Error 500: Failed to load explanation"

**Do say:**
> "We couldn't load the explanation right now. The activity will still work normally. Please try again later."

### When There's No Data Yet

**Don't say:**
> "No data available"

**Do say:**
> "We're still getting to know your learner. After a few sessions, we'll show more detailed insights here."

### When a Feature is Unavailable

**Don't say:**
> "Feature disabled"

**Do say:**
> "This feature isn't available yet. We're working on bringing more insights to you soon."

## Accessibility Considerations

1. **Screen readers**: Ensure all copy makes sense when read aloud
2. **Cognitive load**: Keep sentences short and clear
3. **Jargon**: Avoid educational jargon unless in teacher/admin contexts
4. **Action clarity**: Make it clear what users can do next
